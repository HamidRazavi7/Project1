                    Commit: A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). It's like
                    when you save a file, except with Git, every time you save it creates a unique ID that allows you
                    to keep record of what changes were made when and by who.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Repository: Git saves different versions of projects in a folder known as Repository. Repositories
                    allow restoring a collection of files that contain various versions of a project. You typically
                    obtain a Git repository in one of two ways: You can take a local directory that is currently not
                    under version control, and turn it into a Git repository, or You can clone an existing Git
                    repository from elsewhere. In either case, you end up with a Git repository on your local machine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Merge: merging commits changes to another location. To be more specific, merging takes the contents
                    of a source branch and integrates them with a target branch. In this process, only the target branch
                    is changed. The source branch history remains the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Branches: A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of the commits. The
                    default branch name in Git is master. As you start making commits, you’re given a master branch that
                    points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, the master branch pointer moves forward
                    automatically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tags: Like most version control systems, Git has the ability to tag specific points in a
                    repository’s history as being
                    important. Typically, people use this functionality to mark release points (v1.0, v2.0 and so on).
                    In this section, you’ll learn how to list existing tags, how to create and delete tags, and what the
                    different types of tags are.
