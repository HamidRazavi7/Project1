                <p>&#9642; Commit: A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). It's
                    like
                    when you save a file, except with Git, every time you save it creates a unique ID that allows you
                    to keep record of what changes were made when and by who.</p>
                <p>&#9642; Repository: Git saves different versions of projects in a folder known as Repository.
                    Repositories
                    allow restoring a collection of files that contain various versions of a project. You typically
                    obtain a Git repository in one of two ways: You can take a local directory that is currently not
                    under version control, and turn it into a Git repository, or You can clone an existing Git
                    repository from elsewhere. In either case, you end up with a Git repository on your local
                    machine.</p>
                <p>&#9642; Merge: merging commits changes to another location. To be more specific, merging takes the
                    contents
                    of a source branch and integrates them with a target branch. In this process, only the target branch
                    is changed. The source branch history remains the same.</p>
                <p>&#9642; Branches: A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of the commits. The
                    default branch name in Git is master. As you start making commits, youâ€™re given a master branch that
                    points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, the master branch pointer moves forward
                    automatically.
