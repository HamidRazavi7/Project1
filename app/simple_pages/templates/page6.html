                To set up the project by using GitHub actions, I created workflows. The workflows run tests on pull or
                push
                requests. The development workflow (dev.yml), is responsible for the push requests and the production
                workflow (prod.yml) is responsible for the push requests. During the push/pull requests, the workflows
                build the container and push it into the Dockerhub. Consequently, the program is deployed into the
                Heroku for the automated running.
            </p>
            <p>
                To review the code using the development server before merging, the following steps are taken:
            <ol>
                <li>The master branch where the code is stored is necessary.</li>
                <li>Another branch needs to be created and modified before being pushed into the GitHub.</li>
                <li>A pull request would trigger the testing.</li>
                <li>Once the test is passed, the branch is merged into the master branch.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                When pushing the master into the GitHub repo, the code would be tested with pytest. The container is
                then
                built and deployed by the production workflow. By creating a production workflow, anytime the code is
                pushed into
                the GitHub, a series of actions is triggered that deploys the app into the production server. For this,
                a DockerHub
                username and password, as well as a Heroku API is necessary. These would be added under the "secret" tab
                of the repository setting.
            </p>
            <p>
                The image of the project can be deployed into the Dockerhub when the master branch is updated. When the
                master
                is updated, a pull request would allow merging the master into another branch. This triggers the
                following steps:
            <ol>
                <li>Test on Heroku runtest</li>
                <li>Build it on Heroku as a container</li>
                <li>Deploy it on Heroku</li>
            </ol>
            Once the step 2 is completed, the Docker repository is updated, you can see the image of the code.
            Anytime
            a pull request is submitted, it creates an image and saves it on the Dockerhub.
