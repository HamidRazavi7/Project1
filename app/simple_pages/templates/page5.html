                    • Instantiation: Is the act of taking a class and making it into an object. Instantiation allows
                    having multiple calculator classes with their own individual properties such as result. In my code
                    example below, I have instantiated the calculator 1 and 2 by adding parenthesis and storying them
                    in the Calculator class.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    calc1 = Calculator()
                    <br>
                    calc2 = Calculator()
                    <br>
                    calc1.result = 8
                    <br>
                    calc2.result = 9
                    <br>
                    assert calc1.result == 8
                    <br>
                    assert calc2.result == 9
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    • Object: Is a self-contained component which consists of methods and properties to make a
                    particular
                    type of data useful. Objects are instances of a class created with specifically defined data.
                    Objects can correspond to real-world objects or an abstract entity. Calculator is an object since
                    you can buy it at a store.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    • Class: Classes are user-defined data types that act as the blueprint for individual objects,
                    attributes, and methods. When you group your functions together you put them in a class. Purpose of
                    class is to put related functions together such as creating a subtraction and multiplication
                    classes.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    class Subtraction:
                    <br>
                    @staticmethod
                    <br>
                    def subtract(value_1, value_2):
                    <br>
                    return value_1 - value_2
                    <br>
                <br>
                </p>

                <p>•	Namespace: It’s like a folder while class is a file. How you cannot have to files names the same in a folder, you cannot have two classes called the same thing in a folder. Order is to have a namespace first and then a class. Namespace is our folder and class are the file. Class being file it has functions inside of it that are the texts that what’s inside the file.
  <br>
                      <br>
                    Example: _init_.py is our file/class inside the operations namespace/folder.
                    <br>
                <br>
                </p>

                <p>•	Constructor: A constructor method is a special function that creates an instance of the class.
                    Typically, constructor methods accept input arguments to assign the data stored in properties and
                    return an initialized object. Whenever the addition object is created it fires the constructor function. So, when an object or class is instantiated, the first method called automatically is called the constructor:
  <br>
                      <br>
                    def __init__(self, tuple_list: tuple):
                      <br>
Self.values = Calculation.convert_args_to_tuple_of_float(tuple_list)
                     <br>
                <br>
                </p>

                <p>

                     <br>
                <br>
                </p>

                <p>

                     <br>
                <br>
                </p>

                <p>

                     <br>
                <br>
                </p>

                <p>

                     <br>
                <br>
                </p>
