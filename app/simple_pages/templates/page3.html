            <p>In order to test the code with pytest, a test folder is created in the root directory. By creating a
                simpletest_test.py
                file, we can monitor and test our code. As an example, assert b"Index Page" in response.data allows us
                to create
                a version of website and get a request to the homepage. If on the home page we have the Index Page
                displayed, it
                passes the
                test, otherwise it does not pass the test by running pytest and would need to be edited
                accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>To create simple pages and successfully testing them, we need to first create a test with the
                simple_pages_test
                file. Next would be creating a blueprint documentation with the init.py file. The final step would be
                creating
                the
                simple pages templates. after completing the steps mentioned, we would run the pytest to make sure our
                code
                functions
                properly before deploying it.

                <li>dev.yml: Development workflow which builds and tests pull requests.</li>
                <li>prod.yml: Production workflow which builds and tests push requests.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>.pytest_cache: offer a mechanism through which other plugins can set values via config. cache.
