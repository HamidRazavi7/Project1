                    &#9642;Inheritance: In Inheritance one class is inheriting the properties and methods of another
                    class.it means that you create a (child) class by deriving from another (parent) class. This way, we
                    form a hierarchy. The child class reuses all fields and methods of the parent class (common part)
                    and can implement its own (unique part). Has two types; single and multiple. Like you have
                    calculator class and statistical calculator. The calculator class could be the parent, and the
                    statistical calculator could be the child. Because in statistical you would have addition
                    multiplication and subtraction already, so you want to take them from the parent class and include
                    in the child class. Class can only have one parent and one child only, basically no grandchildren.
                    This is single inheritance. In multiple inheritance you can put multiple classes together to from a
                    super class which is bundle of classes. Rather than parent child relationship for our regular and
                    statistical calculator we could have a statistical calculator and specify what operations
                    statistical calculator would do by naming the operations. i.e statistical you get addition,
                    multiplication, subtraction, multiplication, mean, mode, and …, they have no dependencies on each
                    other. The bigger the class the harder to use, so make class small even it has one method. By
                    inheritance you can add classes together. The only time you would use parent child relationship is
                    when you must share data like when we have a user object and have system admin with different
                    functionality. We might have parent class which is user, and we might extend it with system
                    administrator and system admin would have additional functionality to go along with each
                    object/user.

                    Example code: class Addition(Calculation)
                    The addition class now has all of the Calculation class code added to it, so we don’t have to repeat
                    it.

                    &#9642;Encapsulation: in instantiation you take a class, and you make a copy of the class in memory,
                    and
                    you can have many copies of a class in memory independent of each other.

                    """Testing the Calculator"""
                    <br>
                    # instantiating the Calculator class

                    in this case we have two individual calculator classes with their own specific operaions which are
                    encapsulated:

                <p>&#9642;Polymorphism: in Polymorphism one shape can do many things. Polymorphism allows to use a class
                    exactly like its parent. Although each child class contains its own individual methods.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    class Addition(Calculation):
                    <br>
                    def get_result(self)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Get_result is the same method name for all four operations/objects. When I call the result on the
                    addition object, I don’t have to put an if statement to inspect. The addition object knows that it’s
                    got a list of numbers and it needs to add that list of numbers, so we have an addition object and
                    get_result method gets the result of the addition operation. The subtraction object gets the result
                    of subtraction operation, and so on for the remaining operations.
                    Depending on the type of the operation it calls the correct method that object and that is part of
                    the polymorphism concept. The core of polymorphism is that each object should know what it can do,
                    in this case my four operations should know how to do the correct calculations for themselves.
                </p>
                <p>&#9642;Abstraction: In object-oriented design, programs are often extremely large. And separate
                    objects communicate with each other a lot. So, maintaining a large codebase like this for years —
                    with changes along the way — is difficult. Abstraction is a concept aiming to ease this problem.
                    Applying abstraction means that each object should only expose a high-level mechanism for using it.
                    This mechanism should hide internal implementation details. It should only reveal operations
                    relevant for the other objects.
                    Is like having a calculator class and then calculations and then operations, they are like layers on
                    top of each other.
